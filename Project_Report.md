**PROJECT DEVELOPMENT REPORT: HEALTHSYNC APPLICATION**

**I. Introduction**
This report outlines the development activities undertaken to enhance the HealthSync application, focusing on user authentication, patient dashboard functionalities, and appointment management. The key areas of development include UI/UX improvements for authentication forms and the implementation of a comprehensive appointment tracking system for patients.

**II. Authentication System Development**

*   **Objective:** To provide secure and user-friendly sign-in and sign-up functionalities with role-based access.
*   **Initial Setup:**
    *   **Sign-in Page (`src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`):** Leveraged the `SignInForm` component to handle user authentication.
    *   **Sign-up Page (`src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`):** Utilized the `SignUpForm` component for new user registration.
    *   **API Endpoints:**
        *   `src/app/api/signin/route.ts`: Handles user authentication requests, verifying credentials and managing session/local storage for user role and email.
        *   `src/app/api/signup/route.ts`: Manages new user registration, saving user details to the database with a default role.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements for Role Selection Dropdown:**
    *   **Challenge:** The native HTML `<select>` element for role selection (Patient/Doctor) on both sign-in and sign-up forms had limited styling capabilities, leading to an inconsistent UI.
    *   **Solution:** Replaced the default `<select>` element with a custom-styled dropdown component in:
        *   `src/app/auth/components/SignInForm.tsx`
        *   `src/app/auth/components/SignUpForm.tsx`
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Used `div` elements and inline styles to create a visually appealing dropdown that matches the application's aesthetic.
        *   Implemented `useState` to manage the dropdown's open/close state.
        *   Incorporated `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` event handlers to provide visual feedback on hover for dropdown options.
        *   Utilized `useRef` and `useEffect` to enable closing the dropdown when a user clicks outside of it, enhancing usability.
        *   Added a visual separator (bottom border) between the "Patient" and "Doctor" options within the dropdown for better distinction.

**III. Patient Dashboard Enhancements (`http://localhost:3000/dashboard/patient`)**

*   **Objective:** To provide patients with a clear overview of their upcoming and previous appointments.
*   **Upcoming Appointments Display:** The dashboard initially fetched and displayed upcoming appointment requests from `/api/appointment-requests`.
*   **"Previous 5 Appointments" Feature Implementation:**
    *   **API Endpoint Creation:**
        *   Developed `src/app/api/appointments/previous/route.ts` to fetch appointment data specifically for the "Previous Appointments" section.
        *   Initially, this endpoint retrieved the 5 most recent 'completed' appointments for the logged-in patient.
        *   **Modification:** Based on user feedback, the API was updated to fetch the 5 most recent appointments *regardless* of their status (pending, accepted, rejected, completed) to provide a more comprehensive history.
    *   **Frontend Integration (`src/app/dashboard/patient/page.tsx`):**
        *   Modified the `useEffect` hook to fetch both upcoming and previous appointments concurrently using `Promise.all` for efficiency.
        *   Introduced a new state variable (`previousAppointments`) to manage the data for past appointments.
        *   Created a dedicated UI card section titled "Previous Appointments" on the dashboard.
        *   Implemented rendering logic to display each previous appointment, including the doctor's name, date, and time.
        *   **Status Display Enhancement:** Updated the display logic to dynamically show the actual status (e.g., "Pending", "Accepted", "Rejected", "Completed") of each previous appointment, aligning with the upcoming appointments section.
*   **Default Doctor Name:**
    *   **Objective:** To ensure a doctor's name is always displayed, even if not explicitly provided by the API.
    *   **Implementation:** Modified `src/app/dashboard/patient/page.tsx` to set "Dr. Ketan Patel" as the default `doctorName` if the `appointment.doctorName` field is null or undefined.
*   **Date Format Standardization:**
    *   **Objective:** To display dates consistently in `DD/MM/YYYY` format.
    *   **Implementation:** Applied `toLocaleDateString('en-GB')` to all date displays within `src/app/dashboard/patient/page.tsx` for both upcoming and previous appointments.

**IV. Appointment System Overview**

The project leverages a robust appointment system with the following key API endpoints:

*   `src/app/api/appointment-requests/route.ts`:
    *   `POST`: For submitting new appointment requests from patients.
    *   `GET`: For fetching appointment requests (can be filtered by user email for patients, or by role for admin/doctor views).
*   `src/app/api/appointments/previous/route.ts`: A newly created `GET` endpoint specifically for retrieving the 5 most recent appointments for a patient (regardless of status).
*   `src/app/api/appointment-requests/[requestId]/route.ts`:
    *   `PUT`: Used by doctors (or admin) to update the status of an appointment request (e.g., from 'pending' to 'accepted' or 'rejected', or 'completed').
    *   `DELETE`: For patients to cancel their pending appointment requests.
*   `src/app/patient/appointments/new/page.tsx`: The frontend page where patients can book new appointments.

**V. Other Dashboards and Components**

While the primary focus of development was on the patient dashboard and authentication forms, the codebase also includes:

*   **Admin Dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`):** Reviewed during initial codebase exploration to understand the overall application structure, though no direct modifications were performed.
*   **Doctor Dashboard and Appointment Details (`src/app/doctor/DashboardNew.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/doctor/appointments/[requestId]/page.tsx`):** These components were also part of the initial codebase review, providing context for the existing appointment management flow, but were not directly altered during this development phase.

**VI. Conclusion**
The project has successfully implemented significant enhancements to the HealthSync application. The improved authentication forms offer a more modern and user-friendly experience, while the patient dashboard now provides a comprehensive view of both upcoming and historical appointments with standardized formatting and improved data presentation. These changes contribute to a more robust and intuitive application for users.
